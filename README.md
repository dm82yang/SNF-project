# SNF-project
## Visulization

## Data processing

## Main Analysis


### Regression analysis and SNF was conducted over several parameter space:
###  a) response variables
###  b) datatypes limiting sample size
###  c) datatypes used in SNF (subset of b)
###  d) cluster number
### Feature selection based on variance was conducted on DNA-methylation data only before standardizing the dataset

## The pca_processing file contains the data pre-processing process using PCA
## The cluster stability file contains the stability tests on clustering result using spectral clustering
