# SNF-project
# The param_loop_updated file contains the main body of the analysis.
# Regression analysis and SNF was conducted over several parameter space:
#  a) response variables
#  b) datatypes limiting sample size
#  c) datatypes used in SNF (subset of b)
#  d) cluster number
# Feature selection based on variance was conducted on DNA-methylation data only before standardizing the dataset
#
# The param_space_visualization file contains code to produce plot.

# TO DO: save cluster information of each step in the loop
